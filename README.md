## Installation
From the official documentation:
```
Minigames should be installed in the AppData\Roaming\KitsuneTails\scripts folder on Windows, in $XDG_DATA_HOME/KitsuneTails/scripts on Linux, or (should you have hacked Kitsune Tails to work on Mac) in ~/Library/Application Support/KitsuneTails/scripts.

On Windows you can get to your AppData\Roaming folder by typing %APPDATA% in the navigation bar of file explorer and pressing enter. On Linux $XDG_DATA_HOME/KitsuneTails/scripts usually maps to the folder ~/.local/share/KitsuneTails/scripts.

Each minigame should have its own folder, named for the game, and within it must have at least a script.lua file containing the gameâ€™s code. There can be other files such as tilemaps, images, or anything else you might load using loadresource, but the main script file must be there for a minigame to work.
```

In other words, find the directory mentioned above for your system, then create a new folder in there called `Foxy Bird` and put this repository's `script.lua` in that new folder.

You could also just check this git repository out straight into your appropriate Kitsune Tails folder, but because the repository name has a hyphen instead of a space, it would show as "Foxy-Bird" in the menu since it shows the directory name there. The choice is yours!

## Future Improvements
I have some ideas for future improvements but this is fully functional and aesthetically up to my standards for a quick little single-day project so I'm going to go ahead and post it, but keep an eye out in case I decide to pick this up again and get weird with it. Or, feel free to do that yourself and show me if you want. Go wild.
