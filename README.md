## Installation
From the official documentation:
```
Minigames should be installed in the AppData\Roaming\KitsuneTails\scripts folder on Windows, in $XDG_DATA_HOME/KitsuneTails/scripts on Linux, or (should you have hacked Kitsune Tails to work on Mac) in ~/Library/Application Support/KitsuneTails/scripts.

On Windows you can get to your AppData\Roaming folder by typing %APPDATA% in the navigation bar of file explorer and pressing enter. On Linux $XDG_DATA_HOME/KitsuneTails/scripts usually maps to the folder ~/.local/share/KitsuneTails/scripts.

Each minigame should have its own folder, named for the game, and within it must have at least a script.lua file containing the gameâ€™s code. There can be other files such as tilemaps, images, or anything else you might load using loadresource, but the main script file must be there for a minigame to work.
```

In other words, find the directory mentioned above for your system, then create a new folder in there called `Foxy Bird` and put this repository's `script.lua` in that new folder. If you don't want to deal with Git Stuff to get the file, just right-click and save this link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JillKatze/Foxy-Bird/main/script.lua

You could also just check this git repository out straight into your appropriate Kitsune Tails folder, but because the repository name has a hyphen instead of a space, it would show as "Foxy-Bird" in the menu since it shows the directory name there. The choice is yours!

## Changelog
### Version 1.1
- Reworked scoring system. Going through a single pipe is now worth a base 100 points due to the below changes.
- Added "Tails Level" system
  - Similar to heat levels from Hades, taking on a number of Tails increases the challenge along with your score.
  - Some tail types effectively increase your pipes cleared per second, thereby making your score go up faster in exchange for more challenge.
  - Other tail types increase the challenge in other ways, and therefore add to a score multiplier.
  - Are you fox enough to challenge the Nine-Tailed Kitsune difficulty level?

### Version 1.0
Initial release. A simple Flappy Bird clone with no options or difficulty settings. Just you, some pipes, your jump button, and gravity.

## Future Improvements
I have some ideas for future improvements but this is fully functional and aesthetically up to my standards for a quick little single-day project so I'm going to go ahead and post it, but keep an eye out in case I decide to pick this up again and get weird with it. Or, feel free to do that yourself and show me if you want. Go wild.
